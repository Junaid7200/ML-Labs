Averaging (also known as bagging) is the simplest, we train multiple models of the same type (almost always decision trees) on random subsets of the dataset (for randomization, sampling with replacement technique is used), completly independent from eachother. We make predictions using each model, the majority vote wins.\n",
    "2. Boosting is when the models are not training independently, one model is supposed to specifically target the samples where the first model had high error. If we have two models x and y and we wanna train them using the boosting technique, model y would specifically train on the samples that model x failed on so they both combine to form a more robust model. Each model builds on the previous.\n",
    "3. Stacking is a 2 step process, first is the training of the base models, and the second step is a manager model trained on the predictions of the base models. The base models are diverse (in bagging and boosting we just use a bunch of models of the same type, mostly decision trees, but in stacking we gotta use diff types of models like svm + knn + decision tree + a simple ANN) and they provide their own independent predictions. A manager model is then trained on those predictions to provide the final prediction."

That scenario is perfect for using bagging so that is why ensemble methods (specifically bagging) would be perfect here. If the data is too complex for a bagging ensemble then boosting could be used since it does better then bagging on complex data. Whether you use bagging or boosting, both would generalize better then a single model."
